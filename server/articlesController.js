        body: `Ice cream is simply one of the best food inventions ever. It's so cold, so creamy, so satisfying! Unfortunately, most ice creams are loaded with tons of sugar and fat. Whether you're going on a calorie cutting or keto diet, you may believe you will never be able to experience the wonders of ice cream ever again.
        Don't lose hope! There's a few options out there if you want to get your ice cream fix in. Let's take a look at three low carb ice creams that you can probably buy from your local grocery store.
        <blockquote>Halo Top Ice Cream</blockquote>
        <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3472" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Halo-Top-Low-Carb-Ice-Cream.jpg" alt="Halo Top Low Carb Ice Cream" width="1200" height="625" />
        Based out of Los Angles, California, Halo Top has become super popular over the past few years. It's for good reason too: they offer many different flavors of ice creams that are all far healthier than regular options.
        That number you see on the carton? It isn't calories per serving. It's calories per pint! Halo Top is also perfect for low carb diets, with less than 10g of carbs per serving.
        <h3>Nutrition information (varies slightly between flavors)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Calories: 75</li>
            <li>Fat: 2.5g</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates: 7g</li>
            <li>Protein: 5g</li>
        </ul>
        <p>_________________________________________________________</p>
        <blockquote>Low Cow Lite Ice Cream</blockquote>
        <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3473" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Low-Cow-Ice-Cream-4153895284-1521147301283.jpg?w=395" alt="Low-Cow-Ice-Cream.jpg" width="395" height="425" />Low Cow Ice Cream is a Simple Truth Organic product. Kroger owns the Simple Truth brand, and it can be found in thousands of grocery stores around the united states.
        Like Halo Top, Low Cow Lite Ice Cream is available in tons of different flavors - and the whole lineup is a great option for keto dieters. This ice cream manages to maintain amazing flavor while still removing a lot of the junk that will bring your diet to its knees.
         
        <h3>Nutrition information (varies slightly between flavors)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Calories: 65</li>
            <li>Fat: 2g</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates: 5g</li>
            <li>Protein: 6g</li>
        </ul>
        <p>_________________________________________________________</p>
        <blockquote>Breyers Carb Smart</blockquote>
        <img class=" size-full wp-image-3474 aligncenter" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Breyers-CarbSmart.jpg" alt="Breyers CarbSmart" width="538" height="240" />
        Breyers is one of America's leading brands of ice cream. They didn't want to miss out on the fun of low carb options, so they introduced the 'Carb Smart' line. This ice cream is specifically made for people on low carb diets (it even says on the packaging!).
        While there isn't as much variety here and it's not as healthy overall, Breyers Carb Smart Ice cream is far cheaper than Halo Top or Low Cow. You can pick up almost half a gallon of this deliciousness for about the same price as a quart of the previous two options.
        <h3>Nutrition information (varies slightly between flavors)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Calories: 120</li>
            <li>Fat: 6g</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates: 5g</li>
            <li>Protein: 2g</li>
        </ul>
        <p>_________________________________________________________</p>
        <blockquote>Find Your Own</blockquote>
        There's bound to be local or specialty brands of low carb ice creams that aren't listed here. Read the nutrition labels of some ice cream cartons next time you are craving a cold, sweet treat. You might come across an option that works perfect for you! Remember to subtract the Dietary Fiber and Sugar Alcohol from the Total Carbohydrate count, as these do not affect your diet (fiber and alcohol don't change blood sugar levels).
        <h3>It's important to restrain yourself from going overboard with ice cream.</h3>
        Even these diet-conscious options are bad if you eat too much at a time. Reserve ice cream as a treat to be enjoyed in small quantities at a time.
        If you are on a keto diet, that doesn't mean you have to rob yourself the joys of ice cream! Pick from one of the three above, or find your own, and enjoy with no guilt!`

        category: 'wellness',
        body: `We all live crazily busy lives. The action is nonstop from the moment our heads pop off our pillows. Too often we suddenly realize we are in a state of mental limbo, cruise-controlling our way through the days.

        Being mindful is more important than ever in today's fast-paced environment. With mindfulness, we can claim back the full potential of our incredible intellect. Here are 7 mindfulness practices you should be doing to enhance your own life and every life you touch.
        <blockquote>Be fully present when interacting with other people</blockquote>
        <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3445" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/anna-vander-stel-60342-unsplash.jpg" alt="anna-vander-stel-60342-unsplash" width="500"/>
        
        Whenever you find yourself interacting with someone, make sure you give them your full attention. Being present is almost a lost art in the twenty-first century, yet there is no better way to show respect when dealing with people. Everyone loves being appreciated, but it's hard to feel that way when you can sense someone's mind is somewhere else.
        <h3>Stow your phone at social gatherings</h3>
        Mobile devices are easily the worst culprits when it comes to sucking our attention away. Constant notifications, alerts, and vibrations are designed to keep us checking our phones constantly.
        
        Next time you are eating dinner, going to a game night, or otherwise meeting up with some friends - turn off your phone. Whoever you are spending time with will appreciate the extra focus and attention you'll be able to give them. Don't just silence it. Turn it off! That way, you won't have to worry about your Instagram feed or the latest stock prices. You will be surprised how much easier it is to get fully involved in the socializing.
        <blockquote>Consider how your words will affect a conversation</blockquote>
        <img class=" wp-image-3446 alignleft" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/clem-onojeghuo-381204-unsplash.jpg" alt="clem-onojeghuo-381204-unsplash" width="351" height="234" />Every word you speak will have either a positive or negative effect on the person you are talking to. You should focus your efforts on being uplifting and constructive in your conversations, no matter the situation. Never put other people or their opinions below you. Try showing genuine interest in the things they are saying to you, and respond with positivity and enthusiasm.
        <h3>Before saying anything, pause and predict how it will be taken</h3>
        Ask yourself:
        <ul>
            <li>Is what I'm about to say negative in any way?</li>
            <li>How would I want to be talked to in this situation?</li>
            <li>What can I say to show appreciation to this person?</li>
            <li>Is there any reason to <em>not</em> speak the words I'm about to say?</li>
        </ul>
        Being mindful when speaking to other people will help you form healthier and longer-lasting relationships. Keep it up long enough and you'll cement your place as one of the world's few great conversationalists!
        <blockquote>Put yourself in someone else's shoes</blockquote>
        <img class=" wp-image-3447 alignright" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/irina-253176-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mindfulness Shoes" width="381" height="572" />
        
        The golden rule of the ages is to treat others the way you want to be treated. Taking the concept a step further is the act of putting yourself into someone else's shoes: trying to feel another person's emotions and view situations from the same perspective.
        <h3>Empathy is a trait that is unique to humans</h3>
        Through empathy, we have the power to connect with each other on a level that no other animal can achieve. It is a tool you can use to inspire trust, appreciation, and happiness in those around you. The more you practice putting yourself in the place of others, the more you will appreciate the significance of each human life here on Earth.
        
        Be mindful about other people's existences. Imagine what the whole world would be like if everyone considered each other on a level this deep. You can do your part on a daily basis to help make that dream a reality.
        <blockquote>Notice your feelings without reacting to them</blockquote>
        <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3448" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/samuel-branch-355728-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mindfulness Smiling" width="700" />
        
        An awesome mindfulness is practice observing your own emotions from a separated state. Emotions are really powerful, and they can completely take us over if we are not careful. When you feel strong sentiments beginning to grab hold, immediately take a mental step back.
        <h3>Why are you feeling the way you are?</h3>
        If the emotion you are experiencing is good, notice what makes that emotion appear. Cultivate the emotion and train yourself to summon it at will.
        
        If the emotion is negative, simply shift it out of your mind and move on to something else. You don't really have time for garbage like that anyway, do you?
        
        Being able to notice your feelings without reacting to them is a core part of living a mindful life. Viewing feelings from a distance - and deciding the cause and effect of those feelings - is how you learn to control what's going on inside your head. The moment you have mastered your own emotions is a moment your life will never be the same again.
        <blockquote>Breathe deeply to reset your mental state</blockquote>
        <img class=" wp-image-3450 alignright" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/havilah-galaxy-252446-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mindfulness Breathing" width="366" height="244" />Did you know deep breathing is the ultimate mental cleanser? The deeper you breathe, the more you saturate your blood with oxygen - which is used for almost every system in your body. Brains particularly require a lot of oxygen to operate. In fact, they can use as much as three times the amount of O₂ as muscles! With all that extra oxygen flowing to your head, you will be much more alert and clear-minded.
        <h3>Slow it down</h3>
        Whenever you notice yourself feeling anxious, melancholy, or angry, take a few deep breaths. You'll immediately start to feel better. It's almost magical! Mental benefits include toxin flushing, stress release, and reduced pain. If you want to get serious about deep breathing, look into some deep breathing practices you can add to your daily routine.
        <blockquote>Keep a short daily journal</blockquote>
        <img class=" wp-image-3454 aligncenter" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aaron-burden-90144-unsplash.jpg" alt="aaron-burden-90144-unsplash" width="580" height="435" />
        
        Reflecting back on a day before going to sleep is a wonderful habit to have. Being mindful of your life's details will only leave you better prepared and more motivated to dive into the future. Some of the greatest people in history kept a regular personal journal- including Beethoven, Mark Twain, George Lucas, and Benjamin Franklin. If it helped them, it can certainly help you too.
        <h3>Make it simple</h3>
        There's no need to write a novel before you roll over and let your dreams take you. Nobody has time for that. Consider just a few meaningful things you can jot down for the day. What inspired you? Was there something interesting or surprising that happened today? Who did you spend time with and what did you do?
        
        Mindful journaling is a habit that can give you direction and stability in your life. Try it out! Get a small journal and keep it right by your bed. Who knows? Maybe someday it'll be famous.

        <blockquote>Set a phone reminder</blockquote>
        <img class=" wp-image-3449 alignleft" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlz-gutierrez-de-pineres-64078-unsplash.jpg" alt="Mindfulness Reminder" width="358" height="238" />
        
        In all honesty, it's not easy being mindful. Our old habits and routines make it difficult to implement mindfulness into our lives. A perfect way to regularly practice mindfulness is creating a phone reminder to assist us. Program it to go off every day at a specific time. Try to pick an hour when you tend to be wrapped up in commitments and activities.
        
        A simple title like "Be Mindful" will work great.
        <h3>Here's what to do when the reminder goes off</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pause whatever you are currently involved in.</li>
            <li>Bring attention to your senses: What do you see, smell, taste, hear, and feel?</li>
            <li>Bring attention to your emotions: What is your current mental state?</li>
            <li>Decide on one simple action you can take to make someone else's day a little better. For example, you could compliment your coworker's new haircut or send a text checking up on an old friend.</li>
        </ol>
        Being habitually mindful will completely change your life. A phone reminder is hard to ignore and can help you immensely.
        <p>____________________________________________________</p>
        Give these sevens tips a shot, and see what happens. Most likely, you will enjoy the results so much that mindfulness will become a part of who you are.`

        body: `If you are trying to lose weight, a good workout routine is just as important as your diet. Regular exercise is always a great habit to cultivate, but it is an <em>absolute necessity</em> for shaving off those extra pounds. During this stage of your training, hitting the gym isn't all about building muscle or lowering your mile time. There's specific strategies you need to use to capitalize on the effort you put into exercising. Let's take a look at some exercise tips with the goal of weight loss in mind.
        <blockquote>Burn those calories!</blockquote>
        <img src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BURN-THOSE-CALORIES-300x200.jpg" alt="BURN THOSE CALORIES" width="543" height="362" />
        
        <p>Start doing exercises with the intent of burning calories. Go for a long run at a pace you can manage, or try an elliptical or cycling machine. If you don't feel like any of those options, simply take an hour-or-so walk. This will still burn about 250 calories!</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>The point here is not to increase performance levels, but to create a calorie deficit in your body.</h3>
        </br>
        <p>Your body naturally uses a lot of calories just to keep your systems running, yet every extra calorie you burn during exercise is one less you have to count for the day.</p>
        <br/>
    
        <p>Almost everything that involves some degree of movement is going to fry those calories right out of your body. In general, aerobic exercises will be much better for this than strength training - so maybe skip the dumbbells for now. Find something you really enjoy that gets your heart pumping. Stick with it diligently, and you will crush your weight loss goals faster than ever.</p>
        <blockquote>Exercise on a daily basis</blockquote>
        <img class="alignleft wp-image-3290" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Daily.jpg" alt="Plan Out When you will Exercise" width="305" height="305" />You eat every day, right? Unless you're on some kind of awesome fasting diet, you need to exercise every day. Each ounce of food you put in your body either gets used up, stored, or discarded. The healthiest approach is to use it up as best as you can. The moment when your body runs out of food to use as fuel is the moment it will start using stores of fat for energy. This is exactly the result you are looking for.
        <h3>It's hard to go to the gym on a daily basis.</h3>
        You knew from the beginning that weight loss was going to take a lot of work, and this is just part of your commitment. Make an effort to view your exercise time as holy time. Let nothing except an emergency situation take precedence over it.
        
        Besides, there is something special about using free time to work out. It's cleansing because you know there's only one thing you have to focus on. You can have complete confidence that every minute spent is a productive minute. Not to mention you'll feel on top of the world after you're done.
        <blockquote>Go straight from your bed to the gym</blockquote>
        <img class="alignnone wp-image-3291 size-full" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/skyline-200679_1920.jpg" alt="Morning in the City" width="1920" height="1202" />
        
        Getting your workout in early is key to burning fat. When you first wake up, your body has processed all of the food you ate the previous day. This means that any energy it uses during exercise is coming straight from fat. It's an awesome hack that you can do on yourself for almost instant results!
        <h3>You may find it physically easier to work out in the mornings.</h3>
        Hormone levels are elevated right after you wake up, providing a boost in energy and focus. If you discover you still feel pretty groggy during your morning exercises, try using a caffeinated drink to kick-start yourself into gear. Hot drinks like coffee aren't the best option for this - instead try a healthy powdered mix like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007R1RNUU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007R1RNUU&linkCode=as2&tag=axxion-20&linkId=1cdbba2f2a8fd213344b357dd58646f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zipfizz</a> to make sure you remain completely hydrated for the duration of your workout routine.
        
        Exercise is proven to heighten your mood for up to twelve hours! It only makes sense to take advantage of this early in the day to reap the best rewards. In addition, you probably don't have any other commitments to adjust around in the morning. Knocking your workout off your daily list right away will allow you to spend more time with family, hobbies, and work.
        <blockquote>Have persistance</blockquote>
        If you weigh yourself before you go exercise and again after you are done, you probably won't see any changes. This does not mean your efforts were in vain. Reshaping your body takes a bit of time. Keep at it with ferocious persistence, and one day you'll look in the mirror and realize you are a whole different person!`

        body: `Does this situation sound familiar to you?

        You've been meditating for a few minutes with great success. Everything is going blissfully well, until a nagging strain in your back starts to distract you from concentrating on your breathing. You sit up a little straighter, which helps. Back to breathing. A few minutes later, your neck starts to hurt. Then your shoulders. Gah- it never ends. What is going on? Staying focused during meditation is hard enough without having to endure aches from random parts of your body!
        
        You're not alone in suffering these frustrating distractions. Especially if you are a beginner, it can be common to cut sessions short due to simple discomfort. I was definitely prone to these aches during the first few months of daily meditation.
        
        Luckily, the fix is very straightforward. Employing proper posture will wipe out these troubles faster than a diving falcon. By paying attention to my posture, I am able to meditate much longer and much deeper. I know this will work for you too. Let's take a look at some time-worn tips for perfecting your mediation posture.
        <blockquote>The Seven-Point Posture of Vairocana</blockquote>
        <img class="alignnone wp-image-3198 size-full" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/deity-3132133_1920-1.jpg" alt="Variocana Meditation" width="800" />
        
        Buddhist culture is known for its emphasis on mediation. Vairocana is a celestial Buddha often pictured using a simple yet specific position while meditating. Throughout the years, people have used Vairocana's posture to enhance their own practices.
        <h3>Here it is, broken down into its seven main components:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sit comfortably with your legs crossed.</li>
            <li>Rest your hands in your lap or on your knees.</li>
            <li>Straighten your back. Imagine your spine as a perfect stack of coins.</li>
            <li>Spread your shoulders, like the wings of a large bird.</li>
            <li>Slightly lower your chin. Make sure your neck is balanced atop your spine.</li>
            <li>Relax your jaw and keep the tip of your tongue lightly touching your upper palate.</li>
            <li>Keep your gaze slightly lowered, peering over the top of your nose.</li>
        </ol>
        It might be a good idea to read over these seven points at the beginning of each meditation session until you can get into this position naturally.
        <blockquote>Where to Sit While Meditating</blockquote>
        Where you choose to sit before you start to meditate can make a huge difference to your posture. In general, it is best to sit on the ground. Western culture isn't accustomed to this, so it may feel a little strange the first few times you do it. A pillow or other support is vital in keeping your tailbone elevated and pelvis comfortably rotated forward.
        
        <img class="alignright wp-image-3201" src="https://axxionlifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Zafu-Pillow.jpg" alt="Zafu Pillow Meditation" width="360" height="369" />
        <h3>Did you know there's actually pillows made specifically for meditating?</h3>
        These are called Zafu Cushions - and at the risk of sounding overly enthusiastic, getting one of these changed my life. Zafu Cushions are made to keep their form instead of compacting over time like the stuffing in normal pillows. The one I have is filled with buckwheat kernels, which I had never heard of before getting it. After using one of these for months, I'd call it a necessity for anyone serious about meditation.
        
        Here's a link to the exact cushion I ended up getting: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GU6BKJM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01GU6BKJM&linkCode=as2&tag=axxion-20&linkId=a771f14f888ae3d22b7be4dc36b58775" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peace Yoga Zafu Cushion</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=axxion-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01GU6BKJM" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />
        
        Remember to keep your legs comfortably crossed while sitting. The key word here is comfortable. You probably have seen pictures of people in the lotus position, with their ankles on top of each opposite knee. I know I'm not flexible enough for the lotus position, but you might be. Crossing your legs normally is much easier and still acceptable.

        <blockquote>Find Out What Works for You</blockquote>
        In the end, meditation is always a highly personalized experience. Everyone gets something different out of it, and that goes for posture as well. Follow the guidelines above but feel free to adjust them slightly to fit your body's own tendencies. With a little practice, you'll be pulling hour-long sessions without so much as a ping of pain from your back!`

        body: `Wearable technology is a hot trend - and for good reason! It's crucial to stay connected, informed, and efficient in this modern age. What better way to do that than to strap a mini computer to your wrist? These devices are only getting more popular, and aren't going away any time soon. Eventually, almost everyone will have some sort of wearable technology on them constantly.

        One great byproduct of the explosion in wearable technology is fitness tracking. It's never been easier to log and document things like daily calories burned, heart rate, and steps taken. Keeping tabs on your fitness is an awesome way to keep yourself motivated and helps set proper goals in your health journey.
        
        If you don't already own a fitness tracker, you should consider buying one. Most of them pair to a smartphone app so you can see detailed results of your workouts, active time, and even sleep patterns! Without one of these, it would be extremely difficult and time consuming to record all of this information.
        
        There's a literal truckload of different options in the way of fitness trackers. Let's take a look at some of the best ones to help you narrow down the search for your perfect match.

        As far as fitness tracking goes, Fitbit was one of the first to get on the scene. Devices made by Fitbit are accurate and minimalistic, designed to be worn at all times of the day. Their companion app is excellent and constantly updated with superb new content. The Fitbit Charge HR is a great choice for people who want a robust suite of features in a small, inconspicuous package.

        Pebble's first watch was crowdfunded through Kickstarter, and they grew their product line to include many great devices before they closed their doors. The Pebble 2 + HR Smartwatch is one of Pebble's crowning achievements. It offers great value and an insane battery life for a smartwatch. If you're a practical person who wants a simple yet effective solution, this might be the one for you.

Their Gear Fit 2 Pro smartwatch was designed with fitness tracking in mind, and it delivers on its promise. It will work with both iOS and Android, but has more features available with an Android phone. This model is worth considering if you don't want to miss out on any aspect of fitness tracking.
